# Science & Technology Search Engine for Sustainable Development
Build a searchable collection of science and technology knowledge useful to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.

This project aims to build a curated collection of content relevant to sustainable development, keeping and categorizing content from high quality sources. 

## Content resource  
 The collection of credictable content including websites belonging to this narrow list of owners:

- [National Goverments](http://www.un.org/en/member-states/index.html), this is a list maintained by the United Nations listing the Permanent Missions of the Member States of the United Nations.
- [List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2015/INF/5), this list was obtained from [here](http://csonet.org/).
- [List of academic institutions in the United Nations Academic Impact](https://academicimpact.un.org/sites/academicimpact.un.org/files/UNAI%20MEMBERS%20LIST%20September%202016.pdf), this list was obtained from [here](https://academicimpact.un.org)

## Classification of content

In addition to being able to find content based on keywords, it would be useful to be able to narrow down search results by the type of content found. These are some ideas for classification:
- By type of media: documents, videos, images, etc.
- By language
- By topic: health, poverty, energy, climate, water, etc.
